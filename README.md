The Sega Saturn Smart Home Project
from bl3i

Here contains the code for the Sega Saturn Smart Home v0.4.5.
Watch the YouTube video @ https://youtu.be/o6kFTAdcRiw

The code is intended for use with the Jo Engine library, found @ https://www.jo-engine.org/home/
You can download the .iso and run it yourself @ https://bl3i.com/sssh
How to hack/integrate it with an Alexa is also detailed on that page, as is my personal blog in how and why I did this.
The internet is WRONG about being able to build your own Alexa using a Raspberry Pi. Unless I find out differently, the AVS service that many instruction sheets use was shut off late last year (2024)


Code is open source/do what you like. I wouldn't mind a shout-out though, or keeping me apprised of any of your own modifications.
